Introduction to AutoML Framework:
AutoML in empowers users to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to
model deployment, through user-friendly libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow AutoML, and H2O.ai.
By automating tasks like model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, Python-based
AutoML frameworks make machine learning accessible to users with varying expertise levels.
These tools efficiently explore the model search space, customize optimization objectives, and seamlessly
integrate with existing data science workflows, ensuring scalability and performance across diverse
datasets and computing environments.
This type of computing the data with AutoML makes it easy for the programmer to eradicate errors
and simplify tasks. We are also allowed to customize the control as per your needs.
This may be beneficial for many organizations to extract insights from data. They also give priority to
the transparancy and interpretability of the model.
